Output:

A string representing the binary equivalent of the given integer n.
Example:

Example 1:     |     Example 2:        |     Example 3:
               |                       |
Input: n = 5   |     Input: n = 32     |     Input: n = 1
Output: 101    |     Output: 100000    |     Output: 1
